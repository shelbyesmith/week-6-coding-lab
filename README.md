# week-6-coding-lab
linear regression practice


explore data, perform linear regression, and evaluate diagnostic plots to assess model assumptions. The objectives of Lab Week 6 are:

- Example of rank-based tests for rank / medians comparison (Mann-Whitney U)
- Simple linear regression by OLS in R with lm()
- Check assumptions of OLS (diagnostic plots with plot())
- Visualize linear model, and summarize in text
- Find correlation by Pearsonâ€™s r
